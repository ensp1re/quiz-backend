# ðŸ§  IQ Quiz Proof Generator

Welcome to **IQ Quiz**! ðŸŽ‰  
This project combines a fun IQ test with zero-knowledge proof verification â€” allowing users to prove their IQ score authenticity without revealing private test data!

## ðŸš€ What It Does

- ðŸŒŸ Users take an IQ quiz and get their IQ score.  
- ðŸ”’ The score and username are turned into a zero-knowledge proof (ZK Proof), verifying the score without exposing test answers.  
- âœ… The circuit checks that IQ scores are realistic (max 200) and commits them as public inputs.  
- ðŸ“¡ The backend (`api_server`) generates a zk-proof on-demand using SP1.
